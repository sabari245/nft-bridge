created the images of NFTs needed for uploading

the smart contract wallet's get the metadata of each NFT from the tokenURI() function.

here is the format of NFT Metadata:
{
   "name": "name it",
   "image": "ipfs://QmR36VFfo1hH2RAwVs4zVJ5btkopGip5cW7ydY4jUQBrKW",
   "description": "description",
   "attributes": [
        {
          "trait_type": "Artist",
          "value": "value"
        },
] }

tomorrow's work:

* upload the images to the IPFS or pinata or whatever
* update the smart contract 
    * map the tokenId to tokenURI
    * the tokenURI should respond with the json
    * map tokenId to prompt
    * create the function to respond with the prompt when passed in the tokenId
* create deployment script
* check if the deployment is done properly
* learn about bridging and learn about implementing those functions as well
